Hypothese Testing: Test 1: Comparison of completion rates between the old (Control) and new (Test) website designs. H0 Test  = Control
Result: P-value: 2.0074416931150348e-51

Test 2: Examination of whether the increase in completion rate with the new design meets or exceeds a predefined threshold of 5%. H0 increase rate = 5%
Result: P-value: 0.000

Test 3: Analysis of whether the new design is more popular among older users (aged 50-80) compared to the control group.
Result: P-value: 1.0

Methodology: Research, Data collection, Data wrangling

Conclusions after analysis: AB testing conducted on the old and new website designs yielded insightful findings regarding user engagement and preferences.
In summary, the AB testing provides strong evidence that the new website design leads to significantly higher completion rates compared to the old design and meets or exceeds the predefined threshold for improvement.
